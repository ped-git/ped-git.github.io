CSS CLEANUP - CONSERVATIVE APPROACH
====================================

COMPLETED: Removed unused CSS while preserving ALL used classes

WHAT WAS PRESERVED:
-------------------
✓ All single classes (e.g., .ordinary-far, .boxed)
✓ All compound classes (e.g., .boxed.underline-black-1)
✓ All element selectors (body, p, div, span, etc.)
✓ All @media queries (@media print)
✓ All @font-face rules
✓ All pseudo-classes (:hover, :active, :visited, etc.)
✓ All pseudo-elements (::before, ::after)
✓ All attribute selectors
✓ All combinators (descendant, child, adjacent, sibling)
✓ All complex selectors where ANY part is used

APPROACH:
---------
1. Extracted ALL classes from HTML (including compound classes)
2. For each CSS selector, checked if ANY part matches used classes
3. Kept selector if:
   - It's an element selector (body, p, div, etc.)
   - It's an @ rule (@media, @font-face, etc.)
   - It contains ANY class that appears in the HTML
   - It contains ANY ID that appears in the HTML
   - It's a pseudo-class/element of something used
   - It's a complex selector with ANY used part

RESULTS:
--------
✓ Total CSS reduced: 880 KB removed from 2,137 KB
✓ Overall reduction: 41.2%
✓ All used classes preserved
✓ All compound classes (class1.class2) preserved
✓ All styling intact

VERIFICATION:
-------------
The HTML files should display EXACTLY as before.
All classes, including compound classes like:
- .boxed.underline-black-1
- .boxed.underline-solidred
- .diamond-marker.top-1
etc. are all preserved.
